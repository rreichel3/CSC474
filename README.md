# Network Security Projects
###Implementation of CSC474, Network Security projects in Go
This is a repo that contanins my implementation of some of our network security projects in Go.
Our projects were required to either be implemented in Python or C, so instead of just posting those up here (which felt wrong because it makes copying easy) I decided to just reimplement them in my favorite language. 
So far this repo only contains a few of the projects as I am working diligently to port the rest of them over to Go. 

###Current Program List:
- UnencryptedIM.go  | A basic messaging client over TCP that can act as a server or client
- EncryptedIM.go    | An encrypted messaging client that uses two user preshared authenticty and confidentiality keys
